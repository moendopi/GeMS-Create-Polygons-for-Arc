# GeMS-Create-Polygons-for-Arc

These three scripts do exactly what they are named. They take their respective lines layers and create polygons and add fields. Unlike the GeMS MakePolygons tool, 
these are simple, with simple input and simple output. They will not add polygons to an existing MapUnitPolys like the MakePolygons tool does. It just creates
a new polygon layer. Same for MapUnitOverlayPolys and OverlayPolys.
